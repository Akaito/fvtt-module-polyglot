# Polyglot
Talk to others using a language you can speak and scrambles text you can't understand.

# Installation
In the setup screen, use the URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kakaroto/fvtt-module-polyglot/master/module.json` to install the module.

As DM go to the `Manage Modules` options menu in your World then enable the `Polyglot` module.


# Using it

A language selection dropbox is available above the chat text box so you can select which language you want your character to speak in. Text will be posted in that language only if it's an in-character message.

The list of languages you can speak in is the list of languages that the charactes of the selected tokens comprehend (excluding custom languages). If no tokens are selected, then the character that the user represents will be used.

If no languages are available (no tokens, no character selection), then `Common` will be available by default, unless you are the GM, in which case, all the languages are available.

Changing your selected token or character representation will scramble/unsramble text from messages posted within the last 24 hours.

As GM, you can also click on the language button (colored globe) to unscramble a specific message
